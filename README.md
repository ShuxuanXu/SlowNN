# SNN - SlowNN (Slow Neural Network)
This repo keeps a record of me learning, reproducing and playing around with 
various neural network techniques. It is indeed expected to be **SLOW** and 
**INEFFICIENT**, from which its name comes. 

The current repo includes the following neural networks \
<span style="color:red">&#11044;</span> Not implemented yet\
<span style="color:orange">&#11044;</span> Already implemented, but only 
applicable for built-in, hard-coded or coupled internal testruns\
<span style="color:yellow">&#11044;</span> Already implemented and can be 
externally called\
<span style="color:green">&#11044;</span> Fully tested and benchmarked against 
the reference papers, ready for more general tasks\
